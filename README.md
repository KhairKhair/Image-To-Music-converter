  The uploaded image is resized to be 16x16. the first 4 rows and the last 4 rows are used to generate chords which will play continously.
  The middle 8 rows are used to generate melody notes which are played with the chords.
  The visualizer, the window that is opened after clicking play, turns a pixel white when the melody note generated based of it is played.
  The music and visualizer window is closed automatically when the melody notes finish playing - although the complete midi file may contain some chords after the last melody note.
